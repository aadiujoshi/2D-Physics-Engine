HOW TO USE:
 - The three vectors show the velocity, horizontal velocity, and vertical velocity. This represents the initial point of the projectiles
 - Use the WASD keys to move the intial point
 - While the mouse is held down, the vector will point towards it
 - Press the spacebar to create a projectile
 - The + and - keys change the velocity of the initial ponit (velocity of the projectiles)
 - To scroll across the map, use the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys
 - The R key resets everything
 - You can set custom parameter values using the options menu. Click the "Update values" button to apply the changes
 
  NOTE:
   - Air Resistance has not been implemented as of v1.2.1
   - The projectile depth and projectile mass fields have no purpose as of v1.2.1, since they are only used for calculating air resistance
