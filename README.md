HOW TO USE:
 - The three vectors show the velocity, horizontal velocity, and vertical velocity. This represents the initial point of the projectiles
 - Use the WASD keys to move the intial point
 - While the mouse is held down, the vector will point towards it
 - Press the spacebar to create a projectile
 - The + and - keys change the velocity of the initial ponit (velocity of the projectiles)
 - To scroll across the map, use the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys
 - The R key resets everything
 - You can set custom parameter values using the options menu. Click the "Update values" button to apply the changes
 - To alternate between regular projectiles and explosive ones press the B key
 
  NOTE:
   - Air Resistance has not been implemented as of v1.3.0
   - As of v1.3.0 the collision option only uses a simple stacking and side collision method. Weight distribution is not factored.
   - Explosion physics was highly simplified. It ignores projectile acceleration from an explosion, and its projected surface area, and other air/gas laws.
